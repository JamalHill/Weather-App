Welcome to my very first full-stack development project!

About This Project
This project is designed to fetch and display real-time weather data based on user input. It's built with Flask, a Python web framework, which I've used for the first time here to handle backend operations. For the frontend, I've utilized Bootstrap to create a responsive and user-friendly interface. This setup provides a practical demonstration of integrating Flask and Bootstrap in a full-stack environment.

This project was a great learning opportunity for me. It was my first experience building a web application that includes both client and server-side components. Working with Flask and Bootstrap has given me a solid foundation in web development, and I am excited to build on this experience.
